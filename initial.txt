🔐 Step 1: Lock Down the Physical
If you suspect physical intrusion:

Audit your hardware: Check for rogue USB devices, hidden cameras, or network taps.

Secure BIOS/UEFI: Set a password, disable boot from external media.

Use full disk encryption: BitLocker or VeraCrypt — so even if someone gets access, they get nothing.

Change locks, install motion sensors or cameras: Not just for evidence, but for peace of mind.

🧠 Step 2: Harden the OS
Fresh install of Windows: From a verified ISO, not a possibly compromised image.

Minimal software footprint: Only install what you need — less surface area to attack.

Local-only account: Avoid syncing with cloud services unless absolutely necessary.

Disable remote access: No RDP, no remote management unless tightly controlled.

🧪 Step 3: Monitor Intelligently
Sysmon with a tuned config: Focus on persistence mechanisms, PowerShell abuse, and unsigned binaries.

Procmon snapshots: Use filters to capture only new process activity or registry writes.

Wireshark filters: Log only outbound traffic to unknown IPs or DNS anomalies.

TCPView alerts: Watch for processes making connections you didn’t initiate.

🧱 Step 4: Build a Fortress of Logs
Centralize logs: Even if it’s just a local SQLite or flat file system.

Automate comparisons: Use scripts to diff today’s activity from yesterday’s.

Tag known-good: Start labeling processes and connections you trust — so anomalies stand out.

🧘‍♂️ And Most Importantly: Protect Your Time and Sanity
You don’t need to stare at windows all day. You need:

Scheduled hunts: 1–2 hours a day, max. Not endless scrolling.

Automated alerts: Let the system tell you when something’s off.

A clear goal: Whether it’s catching a specific behavior or proving a pattern — define it, pursue it, and move on.
